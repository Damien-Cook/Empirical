                    <div class="newssubheading">Announcing a new motion-capture technology that allows the game to write its own animations, EA says it's too powerful for PCs.</div>
                    <div class="newstext"> 
                        <p>Few topics cause more aggression between gamers than the relative strengths of console and PC gaming, and now EA has come out firmly for the former.</p>
                        <p>The forthcoming version of FIFA 22 on PC will be missing features available to the latest generation of console players, the company has confirmed, due to differences in specs.</p>                        
                        <p>As the latest trailer footage for the game shows, EA has included "groundbreaking new HyperMotion gameplay technology" which the company doesn't expect PCs to be able to handle.</p>                        
                        <p>The motion capture technology - highlighted in the trailer - is based on special motion capture suits worn by players to inform how their movements are generated by the game engine.</p>                        
                        <p>As EA explained: "Xsens suits record every touch, tackle, sprint and duel from all 22 players playing at high intensity for the first time ever, capturing data that powers over 4000 
                            new animations in FIFA 22 to raise the footballing intensity, responsiveness, and physicality of every player in the game."</p>                        
                        <p>Combined with "a cutting-edge proprietary machine learning algorithm" that has learned "from over 8.7 million frames of advanced match capture", this technology will be able to write
                            new animations "in real time to create organic football realism across a variety of interactions on the pitch".</p>                    
                        <p>But the technology is only available on PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and Google Stadia - meaning last-generation console gamers and those with PCs won't be able to enjoy it.</p>
                        <p>As a gaming franchise FIFA has regularly been more of a console experience than a PC one, mainly due to EA's apparent disinterest in allowing PC gamers to themselves choose a build that would suit their specs.</p>
                        <p>FIFA 21 also featured a downgraded version for PC gamers, something which executive producer Aaron McHardy explained was because FIFA players who were also PC gamers didn't tend to have the most advanced gaming rigs.</p>
